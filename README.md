purpose of this repository is to know how does Version control works

Version control is similar to a collaborative tool for developers. It makes it possible for several developers to work together effectively. Any developer can add new features and modify an existing project. Since version control keeps track of all these changes, it's fantastic. As a result, we may simply go back to the previous state if something goes wrong.
It also has an advantageous feature called "branching." It's like working on a new idea without getting in the way of the current task. When the new idea is ready, we can easily integrate it into the main project.
In order to publish our work online when the time comes, we now have CI/CD pipelines in place. These are like magical helpers. They confirm that everything works as it should and if it's good to go, they automatically send our work to where others can use it.
